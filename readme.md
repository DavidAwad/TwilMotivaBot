# Pick yourself up.

Send yourself a motivating text message with a quote of the day. Whenever you
think that should be.

## Usage
You can simply plug your Twilio credentials into secrets.py and you can get a
small motivational boost every morning!

the code is very simple, everything is inside `server.py`, we set up a twilio
client, and ping the quotes of the day api for the quote every day. then we just
send a text to the soon-to-be happy camper.

## Potential use case!
Does this affect a person's pschology? why not find out for yourself?

##### this is the second python bot in a series of python bots i'll be building based on whatever ideas I come up with. Some of them are one-offs, simple api mashups, others are much more involved. Let me know what you think would be a good bot! I hope you find them useful.
